""Hello, I have questions about some of these guidelines. Who is the best person for me to ask? Should I continue to ask you or reach out to someone at MoPH?     My immediate questions are:    1) What is the start date of implementing these guidelines? I noticed that one of the guidelines said it was created on April 4th. Is that true of all of them?   2) When did MoPH started contact tracing? The document says that contact tracing happens for those who test positive or show symptoms upon arriving to mentioned airports and border points. What if someone tests positive in other locations? How is contact tracing done for them?   3) When was the first day that testing became available in Afghanistan? When it did, was it available for everyone? Or was there a criteria for who could get tested? What is the criteria (generally available or available to only those who show symptoms) for testing now?    Can you please respond to each questions? If you don't have answers, please let me know and I will try to reach out to others.     Thanks so much!""    Their response:    ""Each guideline has been developed in different time frames based on need while most of them were developed in February.   The contact tracing started by the first COVID19 confirmed case on 24th February 2020; however, the national and provincial contact tracing teams were established on 27th February. The contact tracing is done for all confirmed cases form all over the country through phone calls. There has been a form, SoP, and guidelines developed for the purpose, I am copying Momena Jan (the national focal point of contact tracing) for more info if needed.   The testing was available in early February and it was based on the case definition of that time (only people coming from China in points of entries having sign and symptoms of the disease were tested) then when Iran was also confirmed as a country with transmission potentials, the passengers from Iran was also screened and if they had sign and symptoms they were also being tested.   I hope it helps.   In case of more information, we would be happy to help.   Regards"""

Afghanistan,AFG,20200514,H1: Public information campaigns,2,1,"[How can fragile countries, like Afghanistan, respond to COVID-19?  As countries rich and poor struggle with challenges in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Afghanistan is taking proactive steps to overcome its own.  The broader response of the Afghan MoPH has been to make use of the existing immunisation infrastructure. As a health intervention that reaches 82% of the Afghan population and acts as a bridge to further primary health care, immunisation service delivery forms an integral part of the emergency response plan.  The response plan identified four key aspects of immunisation service delivery that are already being used to help tackle the virus:      Religious leaders – for disseminating messaging around vaccination and measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.     Community Based Outreach Vaccinators – to raise awareness about the disease and reinforce prevention measures in hard-to-reach areas.     Volunteers – a network of around 60,000 people trained in vaccine-preventable disease surveillance, who will also orchestrate COVID-19 surveillance, contact tracing, diagnostics and quarantine duties.

Ghani calls for all to stay in their homes during Eid, says the Presidential Palace.  Despite the limited testing capacity, the Public Health Ministry has reported an average of 500 new confirmed cases each day over the past week. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Afghanistan is nearing 9,000.  Health officials continue to warn people against indifference to the lockdown rules, but less and less attention is being paid to health advice, such as to use a mask, gloves and maintain social distancing.  Kabul governor Mohammad Yaqub Haidari said that poverty among families, as well as the arrival of Eid, has caused crowds to increase in the city.  “The situation is not normal. It is an emergency. The virus is spreading. We will ease the lockdown as the situation improves,” the governor said.  “It is not poverty only that pushes people to go out of the house; some are going out to buy dry fruit while they can live without it,” the deputy minister of public health, Wahid Majroh, told a press conference on Thursday.]  https://web.archive.org/web/20200521211535/https://tolonews.com/afghanistan/kabul-lockdown-eases-amid-warnings-crisis"

UNICEF Afghanistan Representative said the provision of sanitation and hygiene facilities would be supported for children both in schools and community-based education centres. He said it was not known when schools would reopen formally due to the evolving situation. “If it comes in winter season, then we need to get prepared the schools and the kids as well.”    On the other hand, the Ministry of Education (MoE) says they have been working on alternative options for the education system in the country.    Nooria Nehzat, spokeswoman for the MoE, told Pajhwok they conducted short term courses in the open sky where social distancing was also observed nation-wide.

The repo rate was lowered from 6 percent to 5.75 percent effective March 24th and was further reduced to 5.25 percent effective April 12. The CRR was initially reduced from 5 percent to 4.5 percent (daily-basis) and from 5.5 percent to 5 percent (bi-weekly basis), with a further reduction to 3.5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, from April 15. BB has also raised the advance-deposit ratio (ADR) and investment-deposit ratio (IDR) by 2 percent to facilitate credit to the private sector and improve liquidity in the banking system. The Export Development Fund was raised to $5 billion, with the interest rate now fixed at 2 percent and the refinancing limit increased. BB has created several refinancing schemes amounting to a total of Tk 380 billion and a 360-day tenor special repo facility to support exporters, farmers and to facilitate the implementation of the government stimulus packages. To further support farmers, BB also announced an agriculture subsidy program that will take effect for 15 months until mid-2021. In addition, BB has taken measures to delay non-performing loan classification, waive credit card fees and interests, suspend loan interest payments, impose restrictions on bank dividend payments, extend tenures of trade instruments, and ensure access to financial services.    EXCHANGE RATE AND BALANCE OF PAYMENTS  Foreign exchange rules were eased by Bangladesh Bank to provide foreign currency to the Bangladeshi nationals who are visiting abroad and facing problem in returning home due to travel disruptions, and to allow foreign owned/controlled companies operating in Bangladesh to access short term working capital loans from their parent companies/shareholders abroad to meet actual needs for payments of 3-month wages and salary.

Central African Republic,CAF,20200416,H3: Contact tracing,1,,"16 April 2020  The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Central African Republic (CAR) increased sharply in the reporting period, jumping from 12 on 15 April to 64 on 30 April, with still no casualties reported. Imported cases, mostly from Cameroon, CAR’s main trading partner, make up 75% of the total (48 out of 64). The CAR authorities have therefore stepped up efforts to control the flow of travellers coming from Cameroon, increasing sanitary controls at the main border crossings and along the main road to the capital Bangui. On 27 April, the Interior and Transport Ministers issued a joint decree suspending traffic between four main Cameroon border crossing towns (Ngaoundaye, Garoua- a-Boulai, Gamboula and Yantchi) and Bangui for a duration of 1 month. Exceptions apply for commercial trucks, as well as official, and UN and humanitarian NGO vehicles. All active confirmed cases are currently located in the capital Bangui. However, with the current acceleration of both importation and local transmission, the risk that the epidemic will eventually reach the interior of the country is increasing.   https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/UNICEF%20Central%20African%20Republic%20Humanitarian%20Situation%20Report%20COVID-19%20No.%202%20-16-30%20April%202020.pdf    17 April 2020  The MINUSCA Rwanda Contingent has donated a COVID-19 screening device to the Central African Republic (CAR).

Further measures by the ECB for which Greece is eligible include an additional €750 billion asset purchase program of private and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, PEPP) until end-2020, an expanded range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase program (CSPP), and relaxation of collateral standards for Eurosystem refinancing operations (MROs, LTROs, TLTROs).    The ECB Banking Supervision is allowing significant institutions to operate temporarily below the Pillar 2 Guidance, the capital conservation buffer, and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). In addition, new rules on the composition of capital to meet Pillar 2 Requirement (P2R) were front-loaded to release additional capital. The ECB considers that the appropriate release of the countercyclical buffer by the national macroprudential authorities will enhance its capital relief measures. The ECB Banking Supervision entity, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) further decided to exercise – on a temporary basis – flexibility in the classification requirements and expectations on loss provisioning for non-performing loans (NPLs) that are covered by public guarantees and COVID-19 related public moratoria; and recommended that banks avoid pro-cyclical assumptions for the determination of loss provisions. Furthermore, the ECB recommends that banks opt for the IFRS9 transitional rules.    Banks will allow deferral of principal payments on existing loans for hard-hit individuals and firms through end-September (in addition to the interest payment subsidies mentioned above).    https://web.archive.org/web/20200529123319/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

The app was released while Iran is in the midst of a national health crisis, with the country being one of the most impacted countries in the world by the novel COVID-19 coronavirus.    After it's release, Iran's Health Ministry sent a mass SMS message to all Iranians urging them to install the app to check potential COVID-19 symptoms.    The app would let users register using their phone number and then ask Iranians to answer a series of questions related to coronavirus symptoms.    The idea was to let Iranians determine if they had severe symptoms, in order to prevent citizens from needlessly flooding local hospitals.    However, the app would also request access to real-time geo-location details, which it would immediately upload to a remote backend.  https://web.archive.org/web/20200525203044/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7187764/"

Effective immediately, mortgagors who are laid off can apply for a moratorium on all loan payments of three months in the first instance. The NHT will also provide a special one-off offer to contributors, the option to reschedule delinquent loans. The option will only be made available where the Trust has not already entered into a commitment to dispose of the property.    The opportunity will be extended for 6 months, effective April 1, 2020. During this period, the NHT will consider each mortgage on a case-by-case basis, with the option to extend the tenor of the loan or reduce the interest rate.    The measures include:    - Effective April 1, 2020 the NHT will reduce interest rates on all new loans by 1% (benefitting some 8,000 new mortgagors annually)  - All existing NHT loans will be reduced by 0.5% (benefitting some100,000 existing mortgagors).  Interest rate discounts currently offered to special groups, such as mortgagors aged 55 years and over, the disabled as well as public sector workers will continue.  - The interest rate discounts for the disabled will be effective April 1, 2020 and will also be extended to include the parents of disabled children.  - The NHT will expand the Intergenerational Mortgage Program. Beginning April 1, 2020, the NHT will extend this benefit for eligible applicants for other loan products, such as open market purchases and construction loans. Funding under this Program will be capped at the prevailing loan limit.  - The NHT will also provide greater benefits to contributors over 65 years. Persons in this category will be designated as Voluntary Contributors and therefore be able to access housing benefits with tenures extending up to age 70.  - The NHT will establish a special arrangement whereby, following maturity of the loan, the insurance arrangement at special rates may be continued. The cost savings will enable beneficiaries to continue the protection of their properties in a period of life when their earning power may be at its lowest.  - The NHT will, during FY2020/21, seek to leverage its current mortgage loan portfolio through a securitization transaction to generate additional inflows.

In this context, the production and export of oil has almost come to a stop since January 18, 2020, due to the closure of oil ports and terminals. Assuming the disruption stays for up to end April 2020, and oil production resumes slowly to reach last-year’s average production level by the end of the year, Libya would only produce a daily average of 0.67 million bpd this year (about half of last year’s). As a result, GDP growth will be negative in 2020 (minus 19.4%), but will rebound by 22.2% in 2021, before stabilizing around 1.4% thereafter.""  https://web.archive.org/web/20200504214924/https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/libya/publication/economic-update-april-2020"

With poorly communicated and inconsistent messaging that offers no clear guidelines, their federal government’s inaction has given rise to widespread rumors that are beginning to stoke panic and insecurity.   Given that Mexico can look to the examples of what not to do in the early onset of this crisis — namely China in January, Italy in February and to a certain extent the United States in the first days of March — one would think political leaders there would be implementing different strategies. So far, 118 cases have been reported in Mexico.  We have not heard strong messaging from the Mexican government to “flatten the curve” in an effort to reduce rates of infection, or to practice self-isolation to mitigate transmission. President Andres Manuel López Obrador is adamant about not closing Mexico’s borders or exercising caution at airports. Perhaps his logic stems out of concerns about imposing barriers on trade.

Something I myself experienced.  But not all public transportation was banned, within the capital the main bus lines were running, but were limited to running on “peak” hours. And even though in the U.S. the CDC advises that wearing a face mask isn’t necessary if you are not sick, they were mandatory while riding public transportation in Ulaanbaatar. http://web.archive.org/web/20200404103344/https://www.forbes.com/sites/breannawilson/2020/03/16/mongolia-announces-3-new-covid-19-cases-totaling-4-how-they-got-coronavirus-precautions-right/"

A business or responsible individual, in charge of a social gathering, must ensure records are kept for contact tracing purposes, except where every person in a gathering knows each other.

Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more  than 15 minutes;  2. Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;  3. Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using  proper personal protective equipment  Identification of contacts:  All persons categorized as a contact of confirmed cases should be followed-up, and  monitored for the development of symptoms for 14 days after the last exposure to the  case (i.e. the maximum incubation period). Contacts of suspected cases should also be  considered for contact management if there is likely to be a delay in confirming or  excluding COVID-19 infection in the suspected case, such as delayed testing.  Close contact definition:  A close contact is defined as requiring greater than 15 minutes face-to-face contact with  a symptomatic confirmed case in any setting, or the sharing of a closed space with a  symptomatic confirmed case for a prolonged period (e.g. more than 2 hours).  For the purposes of surveillance, a close contact includes a person meeting any of the  following criteria:  • Living in the same household or household-like setting (e.g. in a boarding school  or hostel).  • Direct contact with the body fluids or laboratory specimens of a case without  recommended PPE.  • A person who spent 2 hours or longer in the same room (such as a GP or ED  waiting room).  • A person in the same hospital room when an aerosol generating procedure is  undertaken on the case, without recommended PPE.  • Face-to-face contact for more than 15 minutes with the case in any other setting  not listed above.  Contact needs to have occurred within the period extending from the day of onset of  symptoms in the case until the case is classified as no longer infectious by the treating  team (usually 24 hours after the resolution of symptoms).  Casual contact definition:  Casual contact is defined as any person having less than 15 minutes face-to-face contact  with a symptomatic confirmed case in any setting, or sharing a closed space with a  symptomatic confirmed case for less than 2 hours. This will include healthcare workers,  other patients, or visitors who were in the same closed healthcare space as a case, but  for shorter periods than those required for a close contact. Other closed settings might  include schools or offices.  Note that healthcare workers and other contacts who have taken recommended infection  control precautions, including the use of full PPE, while caring for a symptomatic  confirmed COVID-19 case are not considered to be close contacts. However, these  people should be advised to self-monitor and if they develop symptoms consistent with  COVID-19 infection they should isolate themselves and notify their public health unit or  staff health unit so they can be tested and managed as a suspected COVID-19 case.  Other casual contacts may include:  • Extended family groups, e.g. in an Aboriginal community.  • Aircraft passengers who were seated in the same row as the case, or in the two  rows in front or two rows behind a symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 case. Contact  tracing of people who may have had close contact on long bus or train trips should  also be attempted where possible, using similar seating/proximity criteria.  • All crew-members on an aircraft who worked in the same cabin area as a  symptomatic confirmed case of COVID-19. If a crew member is the symptomatic  COVID-19 case, contact tracing efforts should concentrate on passengers seated  in the area where the crew member was working during the flight and all of the  other members of the crew.  Where resources permit, more active contact tracing may be extended to other persons  who have had casual contact (as defined above), particularly in school, office, or other  closed settings. In these circumstances, the size of the room/space and degree of  separation of the case from others should be considered in identifying contacts.  Contact assessment:  All persons identified as having had contact with a symptomatic confirmed case should  be assessed to see if they should be classified as a close contact and have demographic  and epidemiological data collected. Information on close contacts should be managed  according to jurisdictional requirements. Identification and assessment of the contacts of  suspected cases may be deferred pending the results of initial laboratory testing.  Close contact testing:  Routine laboratory screening for COVID-19 infection is not recommended for  asymptomatic contacts.  Procedure:  • RRT team shall reach the locality where case reports as per SOPs.  • Team member shall conduct risk assessment of the area and identify the close  contacts as per plan  • The team shall take the sample from the contacts available at the site as per  SOPs  • The detailed information about contacts which are not present at the area of site  must be informed to NIH and the respective agencies.  • The team shall coordinate with local civil authorities about the risk assessment  and advice  • PHEOC team shall facilitate the respective agencies and organization where  relevant contacts may be living or residing  Records:  1. Contact Tracing Forms  2. Contact information forms  3. Sample referral forms  4. PHEOC contract management registers/forms (if any)"

BoU has also worked with mobile money providers and commercial banks to ensure they reduce charges on mobile money transactions and other digital payment charges.    During its April 2020 MPC meeting, BoU reduced its Central Bank Rate (CBR) by 1 percentage point to 8 percent to counter the deteriorating economy, provide adequate access to credit and ensure the smooth functioning of financial markets. Other concrete measures introduced include: (i) directing all Supervised Financial Institutions (SFIs) to defer the payments of dividends and bonuses for at least 90 days effective March 2020 to ensure adequate capital buffers are maintained; (ii) providing liquidity to commercial banks for a longer period through issuance of reverse Repurchase Agreements (REPOs) of up to 60 days at the CBR, with opportunity to roll over; (iii) purchasing Treasury Bonds held by Microfinance Deposit taking Institutions (MDIs) and Credit Institutions (CIs) in order to ease their liquidity distress; and (iv) granting exceptional permission to SFIs to restructure loans of corporate and individual customers that have been affected by the pandemic, on a case by case basis effective April 2020.    On April 17th, Bank of Uganda provided more guidelines to be followed by SFIs to safeguard financial sector stability. These include: (i) loan repayment holidays for a maximum of 12 months; (ii) granting credit reliefs only within the 12 month period with effect from April 01, 2020 –these should be in the best interest of customers and with full disclosure; (iii) the credit status at the time of granting a repayment holiday shall remain unchanged for the duration of the said repayment holiday; (iv) prepayment of arrears as a condition for restructuring a credit facility is suspended for 12 months with effect from April 01, 2020; (v) credit status at the time of granting a repayment holiday shall remain unchanged for the duration of the said repayment holiday; and (vi) borrowers are encouraged to request, and SFIs may offer, credit relief.

Press conference the government health minister says:  ""Search asked him to speak with the person responsible for the ministry's laboratory, the A reference center for diagnosing coronavirus in the country and, until Monday, almost the only one that did the test. Satdjian and Asqueta, more calmly, listened to the proposal and tried to explain the response of the minister, who finally authorized the note.    It happens that in the beginning, when the cases are very few, it is important to carry out the tests and it is also viable to keep track of the people with Covid-19 and their contacts, Asqueta explained. Once the virus has spread, it is more important for the doctor to make the clinical diagnosis and to assist the person, than to confirm her Covid-19 in the laboratory. Although it does matter, once phase three has arrived, which is that of community contagion, it is not the main concern of the health authorities.""  http://web.archive.org/web/20200610000322/https://www.busqueda.com.uy/nota/autoridades-y-asesores-del-msp-aseguran-que-no-es-prioritario-diagnosticar-todos-los-casos-de"

The order from the southwestern state, which comes into effect at 8am on March 24, means the number of US states ordering residents to stay at their residences more than doubled on Monday to 15. Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia and Wisconsin made such announcements earlier in the day.    The 15 states where those orders are effective or about to come into effect cover just over 42 per cent of the population in the 50 states and District of Columbia.    The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US has soared to more than 41,000 as of Monday, 579 of whom have died, according to John Hopkins University. That is more cases than any country after China and Italy, and the number of people who test positive is expected to continue to rise rapidly as the US ramps up the ability to test people with symptoms.    New York is the hardest-hit state, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 5,707 in the past 24 hours, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 20,875.    Some individual cities and counties have issued stay at home orders, even though the states have not. As such, the proportion of the population affected by those restrictions probably exceeds 42 per cent.    Texas, the US's second most-populous state, does not have a stay at home order in place, but local media reported the capital, Austin, was expected to take this route tomorrow, following in the footsteps of Dallas and Waco.  https://www.ft.com/content/f96ada9f-bd2a-39a7-8b59-c4170f5a1101"

The order from the southwestern state, which comes into effect at 8am on March 24, means the number of US states ordering residents to stay at their residences more than doubled on Monday to 15. Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia and Wisconsin made such announcements earlier in the day.      The 15 states where those orders are effective or about to come into effect cover just over 42 per cent of the population in the 50 states and District of Columbia.      The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US has soared to more than 41,000 as of Monday, 579 of whom have died, according to John Hopkins University. That is more cases than any country after China and Italy, and the number of people who test positive is expected to continue to rise rapidly as the US ramps up the ability to test people with symptoms.      New York is the hardest-hit state, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 5,707 in the past 24 hours, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 20,875.      Some individual cities and counties have issued stay at home orders, even though the states have not. As such, the proportion of the population affected by those restrictions probably exceeds 42 per cent.      Texas, the US's second most-populous state, does not have a stay at home order in place, but local media reported the capital, Austin, was expected to take this route tomorrow, following in the footsteps of Dallas and Waco.   https://www.ft.com/content/f96ada9f-bd2a-39a7-8b59-c4170f5a1101"
United States,USA,20200327,E1: Income support,2,0,"Unemployment insurance in the U.S. is state-specific, but overseen by the U.S. Dept. of Labor. On average, unemployment insurance replaces ~50% of lost wages for a finite period of time. The CARES Act, signed into law on 27 March 2020, boosted unemployment benefits by supplementing state benefits with $600 per week, and expanding eligibility to individuals that normally don't qualify for unemployment insurance (e.g. gig workers & independent contractors).

(2)When a person seeks medical attention using his or her National Health Insurance (NHI) card, the person’s travel history to areas affected by COVID-19 will display on the system because immigration data is linked to the National Health Insurance Administration. This system helps remind a physician to pay attention to past 14-day travel history and inquire and examine the person accordingly.
