Is that true of all of them?   2) When did MoPH started contact tracing? The document says that contact tracing happens for those who test positive or show symptoms upon arriving to mentioned airports and border points. What if someone tests positive in other locations? How is contact tracing done for them?   3) When was the first day that testing became available in Afghanistan? When it did, was it available for everyone? Or was there a criteria for who could get tested? What is the criteria (generally available or available to only those who show symptoms) for testing now?    Can you please respond to each questions?

The testing was available in early February and it was based on the case definition of that time (only people coming from China in points of entries having sign and symptoms of the disease were tested) then when Iran was also confirmed as a country with transmission potentials, the passengers from Iran was also screened and if they had sign and symptoms they were also being tested.

Central African Republic,CAF,20200416,20200824,H3: Contact tracing,1,,"16 April 2020  The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Central African Republic (CAR) increased sharply in the reporting period, jumping from 12 on 15 April to 64 on 30 April, with still no casualties reported. Imported cases, mostly from Cameroon, CAR’s main trading partner, make up 75% of the total (48 out of 64). The CAR authorities have therefore stepped up efforts to control the flow of travellers coming from Cameroon, increasing sanitary controls at the main border crossings and along the main road to the capital Bangui. On 27 April, the Interior and Transport Ministers issued a joint decree suspending traffic between four main Cameroon border crossing towns (Ngaoundaye, Garoua- a-Boulai, Gamboula and Yantchi) and Bangui for a duration of 1 month. Exceptions apply for commercial trucks, as well as official, and UN and humanitarian NGO vehicles. All active confirmed cases are currently located in the capital Bangui. However, with the current acceleration of both importation and local transmission, the risk that the epidemic will eventually reach the interior of the country is increasing.   https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/UNICEF%20Central%20African%20Republic%20Humanitarian%20Situation%20Report%20COVID-19%20No.%202%20-16-30%20April%202020.pdf    17 April 2020  The MINUSCA Rwanda Contingent has donated a COVID-19 screening device to the Central African Republic (CAR).

'The work requirement for qualifying for unemployment allowance has been reduced temporarily (.. ) The change will be effective until 6 July 2020.'     The Finnish benefits system is complicated, so it's not possible to clearly define whether income support is set at above or below 50% of normal earnings. There are multiple different types of benefits a person can receive depending on factors such as employment history and union membership. The amount of the base unemployment benefit provided by KELA is means-tested; increases to the base amount will be granted depending on conditions such as the number of children and the availability of other sources of income. Many people who lost their jobs will also be union members who receive earnings-related benefit that are calculated on the basis of duration of employment; in many cases this will be larger than the base amount.     https://web.archive.org/web/20200523110355/https://www.kela.fi/web/en/unemployment-benefit-corona"

Greece,GRC,20200601,20200621,C1: School closing,1,1,"It was decided by the Government to reopen the kindergartens, primary and special education schools of all levels from Monday, June 1, 2020.    This decision was based on the following factors:    First and foremost, in the unanimous proposal of the Public Health Emergency Management Committee by Infectious Diseases for the reopening of these school structures. This suggestion is certainly linked to the steadily declining course of the epidemic, with children having a harder time transmitting and transmitting the virus, and now that the temperature is rising, the safest time to open schools is epidemiologically. Since the beginning of this health crisis, we have had the privilege of being guided by an excellent team of experts, whose recommendations we follow with very good, internationally recognized results. So we go now, and we thank them warmly.  The overall de-escalation of measures has been very positive. As for schools, the previous experience of opening high schools and lyceums is very encouraging. The protection and prevention measures are modeled on the members of the educational community and everything has gone extremely smoothly.  We must ensure the return of all students to their physical space, which is none other than school. The long absence from school hinders their learning process, their spiritual, social, mental development. Primary school students are already out of school for almost 3 months, and would have been there for a total of 6 months if the schools had not been opened now. There can be no regularity without open schools.  Children are safer in school, where they follow rules and follow protection and prevention measures, rather than in neighborhoods and squares without rules. There is no better place than school to adapt and get children used to the new reality. To learn to pay more attention to every aspect of their daily lives.  Open schools reduce social inequalities and empower children from more vulnerable family backgrounds. Students who do not have modern technological equipment, students who experience tension in their family environment, students of the smallest mainly classes who do not have family guidance for distance education.  Regarding special schools, students attending these schools have a special need to be back in their school environment, with their teachers and classmates. And they obviously need it for their learning development but also for their psycho-emotional and social development.  I now turn to how these educational structures reopen:    Regarding primary and secondary schools, they will reopen on Monday, June 1. Classes will be extended until Friday, June 26 (instead of June 15), while for teachers as a whole, the end of the school year will be June 30. For substitute teachers, their contracts will be extended until June 30.  School and kindergarten departments will operate with up to 15 students at a time and with a distance of 1.5 meters on the desks, which will have the same orientation. If the students exceed 15, then the department will be divided into 2 sub-departments, and will operate in rotation, Monday-Wednesday-Friday one, Tuesday-Thursday the other, and next week the opposite. If the students do not exceed 15, then the class will be open daily.  There will be antiseptics in the rooms, cleaning is provided twice a day, both during and after school. Special legislation and additional funds have been provided for the amendment of the contracts of the cleaning staff, as well as the possibility for the recruitment of additional cleaning staff. We thank the Ministry of Interior and the Municipalities for the excellent cooperation in this area.  Breaks are provided at different times to reduce congestion, and canteens are not allowed to operate.  Natural ventilation of the rooms is provided, the use of the mask is optional for teachers and students (both at school and on school buses), special EODY instructions will be sent in the coming days to all primary education structures, and a significant part of the first day will be dedicated to explanation of these instructions. There is a special concern for teachers who fall into the category of special leave of absence as defined by the Ministry of Interior. There is also the possibility of a student being absent, on the basis of a simple responsible statement from a parent or guardian about the existence of a person in the home who belongs to an increased risk group or who is ill.  There is the possibility of modern distance learning by teachers for those students who fall into categories that justify their absence.  For the time being, all-day schools will not be open.  For special schools: they will reopen on June 1st to June 12th for secondary school and until June 26th for primary school. The competent subcommittee of infectious diseases specialists is meeting today to give special instructions for the reopening of the special education units. There will be strict protection measures    https://web.archive.org/web/20200618002455/https://www.minedu.gov.gr/news/45093-25-05-20-omilia-tis-ypourgoy-paideias-thriskevmaton-nikis-kerameos-gia-ta-dimotika-sxoleia-kai-nipiagogeia-2"

The ministry will set up a screening area at the Toussaint L'Overture International Airport in Port-Au-Prince, as well as an area to quarantine passengers suspected of carrying the new coronavirus.  The Director General of the Public Health Service, Dr. Laure Adrien, stressed at a press conference there are no known cases of coronavirus in Haiti, but the ministry wants to actively address the threat from the fast spreading infection.  Haiti's poor public health infrastructure and tightly packed neighborhoods make the island vulnerable to a fast-spreading infection like the coronavirus, and once established in the country would be hard to contain and treat.  Authorities will target passengers coming from affected countries in Asia for special screening and monitoring once they arrive in the country.   Agents from the ministry will be on hand at the airport to immediately screen such passengers for infection before allowing them into the country, and in some cases will quarantine the affected passengers in a holding area set up at the facility."" - Video shows the health ministry announcing the above.

Effective immediately, mortgagors who are laid off can apply for a moratorium on all loan payments of three months in the first instance. The NHT will also provide a special one-off offer to contributors, the option to reschedule delinquent loans. The option will only be made available where the Trust has not already entered into a commitment to dispose of the property.    The opportunity will be extended for 6 months, effective April 1, 2020. During this period, the NHT will consider each mortgage on a case-by-case basis, with the option to extend the tenor of the loan or reduce the interest rate.    The measures include:    - Effective April 1, 2020 the NHT will reduce interest rates on all new loans by 1% (benefitting some 8,000 new mortgagors annually)  - All existing NHT loans will be reduced by 0.5% (benefitting some100,000 existing mortgagors).  Interest rate discounts currently offered to special groups, such as mortgagors aged 55 years and over, the disabled as well as public sector workers will continue.  - The interest rate discounts for the disabled will be effective April 1, 2020 and will also be extended to include the parents of disabled children.  - The NHT will expand the Intergenerational Mortgage Program. Beginning April 1, 2020, the NHT will extend this benefit for eligible applicants for other loan products, such as open market purchases and construction loans. Funding under this Program will be capped at the prevailing loan limit.  - The NHT will also provide greater benefits to contributors over 65 years. Persons in this category will be designated as Voluntary Contributors and therefore be able to access housing benefits with tenures extending up to age 70.  - The NHT will establish a special arrangement whereby, following maturity of the loan, the insurance arrangement at special rates may be continued. The cost savings will enable beneficiaries to continue the protection of their properties in a period of life when their earning power may be at its lowest.  - The NHT will, during FY2020/21, seek to leverage its current mortgage loan portfolio through a securitization transaction to generate additional inflows.

To support businesses experiencing difficulties, in addition to the social measures which have already been introduced (deferred payment of social security contributions and use of temporary lay-offs), the Government has decided to reactivate COMED, the Committee for Assistance to Businesses in Difficulty, which was set up in 1996 and last activated in a significant way in 2008 during the global financial crisis (and to a lesser extent during the more recent work on Rue Caroline).

It is important to remember that the virus does not circulate alone, it is the movement of people which makes a pandemic possible. For this reason, the Prince’s Government, at the instruction of H.S.H. the Sovereign Prince, has taken a series of measures that are required to protect the national community.    http://web.archive.org/web/20201207133041/https://en.gouv.mc/Policy-Practice/Coronavirus-Covid-2019/Actualites/CORONAVIRUS-Weekend-summary-Principality-strengthens-measures-to-contain-COVID-19-epidemic"
Monaco,MCO,20200316,20200319,E1: Income support,1,1,"As part of measures aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus, the Prince’s Government has decided to temporarily close crèches and schools until further notice.    Parents affected who have children aged under 16 (or 18 in the case of children with disabilities) and who are affiliated to the Social Services Compensation Fund (CCSS) or the State Medical Benefits Office (SPME) must, as a first step, discuss with their employer the possibility of switching to home working for the duration of the closure.    Any refusal on the part of the employer must be justified.    Parents who are not able to take advantage of home working can receive paid sick leave, provided that the other parent is not temporarily laid off from their employment.    Only one parent may take leave in this situation, however the leave can be split between them.    Employers are asked to continue to pay their employees’ salaries.    Other categories of people covered by the Principality’s social security schemes should contact their Monegasque health insurance provider for details of the applicable provisions.    Procedure:    -              the employee or public official should contact their employer and assess any options for home working that could be put in place;    -              if home working can be implemented, the specific procedure on “Home Working”, dated 12 March 2020, applies. See:    https://www.gouv.mc/Action-Gouvernementale/Coronavirus-Covid-2019      and     https://service-public-entreprises.gouv.mc/Emploi-et-social/Reglementation-du-travail/COVID19-Travail-a-distance/COVID19-Procedure-de-travail-a-distance    -              if home working cannot be implemented, the employer must declare the employee absent from work and staying at home using the appropriate form, which should be submitted directly to the CCSS or SPME as required (see attached documents);     -              compensation can be paid once this declaration has been made, including:    *             daily allowances    *              and, where appropriate, continued payment of salary by the employer from the first day of leave, without delay.     Daily allowances will be paid by the CCSS or SPME under the following conditions:     -              Only parents of children under 16 on the date that leave begins are covered by this measure. The age limit is set at 18 for children with disabilities who receive care at a specialist institution which is set to close.    -              The parent must be affiliated to a Monegasque social security organisation.    -              Only one parent (or guardian) may be granted leave. To this end, the employee must provide their employer with a sworn statement certifying that they alone are requesting leave for this purpose.    -              Leave may be shared between parents. It can be split by filling in a request for each leave period.    -              There must be no option for the company to offer the employee concerned the opportunity to work from home during this period: leave must be the only possible solution.    The declaration completed by the employer does not result in automatic payment of compensation to the affected employees. Allowances will be paid once the CCSS/SPME and Department of Employment have verified the information provided.         http://web.archive.org/web/20201203130256/https://en.gouv.mc/Policy-Practice/Coronavirus-Covid-2019/Actualites/PROCEDURE-Compensation-for-looking-after-children-at-home-following-closure-of-creches-pre-schools-and-schools-Exceptional-and-temporary-measures-due-to-COVID-19    "
Monaco,MCO,20200320,,E1: Income support,2,1,"""PROTECTING CASH FLOW:    The initial barrier measures taken on the economic and social side relate to the deferment of social security contributions and the use of full or partial temporary layoffs.    As such, a decision was taken last week to introduce a two-month deferment of the payment of VAT collected by businesses for those that request it. This deferment has now been extended to three months. Only the requirement to report VAT returns remains.    Internal VAT, however, as an indirect tax on consumption, will be due.    With regard to financial measures, the initial actions taken as a first step will be strengthened.    Extension of interest subsidy to 0%  The existing measure, which stipulates that companies in the Principality financing a structural investment with a bank loan can now request an interest subsidy on this business loan, will be extended to other companies which request it. This subsidy involves reducing the interest rate charged by the bank for the duration of the loan with a lower limit fixed at the EURIBOR rate +0.75%. The interest subsidy will now be extended to a rate of 0%.    In practical terms, this means that an entrepreneur, retailer, artisan, etc. who applies to their bank for a cash flow loan or an overdraft will pay a de facto interest rate of 0%. Any interest charged by the bank will be covered by the State.    Creation of a €50 million credit guarantee fund  This fund, which may be increased as the situation evolves, is designed to support economic development in the Principality. The amount covered by the guarantee, currently set at 65%, is being increased to 100%.         This means that the State will step in to pay off loans on behalf of entrepreneurs, retailers, artisans, etc., who are not able to repay the loans that they have taken out. To date, the guarantee fund has been replenished by lending institutions and the State on an equal basis. Now, the State is taking on this responsibility.    PROVIDING A MINIMUM INCOME:    The Prince’s Government is aware that this situation is particularly difficult for the self-employed, and is considering the implementation of an exceptional minimum income that will be slightly higher than the Monegasque minimum wage. The self-employed will not be abandoned.    COMMERCIAL RENTS FOR STATE-OWNED PROPERTIES CANCELLED:    The Government has introduced an exceptional measure for retailers occupying state-owned premises. They will be exempt from paying all rent and charges for the entire second quarter of 2020. This is a cancellation of the payment due, not a deferment. Those who have paid rent for March will be reimbursed.    Office and industrial businesses continue to operate, some at a more reduced rate than others, but all will experience a negative impact on their business and revenue. With assistance from the Monaco Order of Accountants (OECM), we are now close to finalising a procedure that will help us to offer them significant support too.    Finally, the Government has also decided – in anticipation of the National Council passing bill No. 1003, based on proposed law No. 238 on Monegasque nationals and their partners carrying out a business activity at home in a state-owned apartment – to exempt those liable from payment for 2020. Those who have already made part payment will be reimbursed, while anyone currently liable will be exempt.    The Prince’s Government is also launching an appeal to private owners, asking them to show a sense of civic responsibility by changing or spreading out the payments due by their tenants. This is in the interests of both owners and tenants. Owners whose tenants are experiencing difficulties can and must do their bit. Owners whose tenants are bankrupt will need to face up to their responsibilities. It would be regrettable if the Government had to go further and propose that the National Council introduce legislation in this area, but no option will be excluded.""    http://web.archive.org/web/20201206151817/https://en.gouv.mc/Policy-Practice/Coronavirus-Covid-2019/Actualites/CORONAVIRUS-Prince-s-Government-presents-additional-measures-to-support-national-economy"

Monaco,MCO,20200416,,H6: Facial Coverings,3,1,"Minister of Health and Social Affairs Didier Gamerdinger today provided an update on the three criteria that will have to be met in the Principality before plans can be made for the period following lockdown: masks, tests and digital tracing.    Distribution of masks to residents will begin tomorrow  Like the majority of countries, the Principality of Monaco has faced difficulties in bringing in masks produced abroad. Supply lines have now been secured and stocks are guaranteed. Initially, the Monegasque authorities reserved masks for healthcare staff on a priority basis, as well as for some other workers, including those in food shops and private security guards.    The Prince’s Government is now in a position to expand distribution. The stated objective is to distribute masks free of charge to all residents and employees of the Principality. For the country’s 38,000 residents, the Government has decided to rely on the manufacture of accredited washable, reusable fabric masks. It has purchased all of the “made in Monaco” output: the 800 masks produced every day by Banana Moon and 80,000 masks which have been ordered from Bettina. The latter are being manufactured at a rate of 1,000 a day, soon to be increased to 2,000. To this will be added an order of 120,000 fabric masks from two Italian companies.    Distribution will begin tomorrow for people aged 65 and over, and will be managed by teams from Monaco City Hall, who already handle the distribution of meals on wheels. Each person will receive two free washable masks which can be reused for a month. Please note that a video tutorial is available via the website www.covid19.mc/en/ and will be regularly broadcast on Monaco Info to teach people how to use and look after the masks correctly.    All other residents will shortly receive the same pack of masks, but by post.    With regard to employees, the Government will record requests for masks submitted by various businesses. Companies will buy single-use surgical masks at cost price. The Louis II Stadium will likely serve as the collection point for business orders.    These single-use masks will also be sold in chemists and authorised shops at prices regulated by the State (€2.50 for a surgical mask and €7.50 for a FPP2 mask).    http://web.archive.org/web/20201208134336/https://en.gouv.mc/Policy-Practice/Coronavirus-Covid-2019/Actualites/Didier-Gamerdinger-today-discusses-masks-tests-and-digital-tracing-All-residents-of-Principality-to-receive-preventive-masks"

The beneficiaries of TOSIKA FAMENO, identified at the fokontany level and registered in the list of beneficiaries established by the respective municipalities, are very poor and vulnerable families, those most exposed to a risk of food insecurity as well as *those whose income is interrupted because of the lock down.*The amount of the transfer amounts to 100,000 Ariary per household, payable in a single installment , for the month of May 2020. A second transfer of the same amount (100,000 ariary) is planned. While only applying to very poor households, this measure still is a measure of income support that is independent of whether previous employment was in the formal or informal sector. As the level of income replacement is a flat rate well below 50 percent of median income, this is rated as 1A despite its limited reach. https://web.archive.org/web/20200505013014/https://www.cnbcafrica.com/africa-press-office/2020/04/28/coronavirus-in-madagascar-a-social-protection-response-is-launched-in-urban-and-suburban-areas-to-aid-families-and-their-children-during-covid-19-pandemic/; https://web.archive.org/web/20200531203933/https://www.fid.mg/tosika-fameno/#1590388088109-e657a849-66fd (see technical sheet for details)"

Drivers of private vehicles that do not engage in paid passenger transport activities are not covered by the mandatory use of masks.    The National Institute of Land Transport urges all motorists and users of public transport to fully comply with the measures approved by the Government of Mozambique, collaborating with the inspection authorities to prevent the spread of COVID - 19 through the means of transport.

Please note that the number and origin of these flights are being constantly reviewed to ensure the timely return of our nationals, whilst ensuring that our capacity to conduct COVID testing and manage these passengers in quarantine facilities is not exceeded. The government is working tirelessly to increase these capacities, and as this capacity continues to grow our ability of passenger intake will also rise.    Scheduled flights for the current week can be viewed here . Please note that these are subject to change depending on the evolving situation.    Upon arrival in Pakistan, all passengers and crew will be subjected to a state-monitored quarantine. Testing will be conducted as soon as possible after arrival, usually before 24 hours. Testing results are returned within a 12-24 hours window. Please note that these might be delayed in some cases due to heavy load of inbound passenger traffic.    The quarantine can be extended based on the result of the passenger’s COVID-19 test, or upon the discretion of governmental health authorities considering the overall test results of the flight. Passengers who are sent home after a negative test will be advised compulsory self-isolation to complete a 14-day period. Low risk and asymptomatic positive test results may also be sent home for self-isolation upon the discretion of provincial health authorities subject to review of isolation capabilities at home.    The transportation to the quarantine location shall be arranged by the concerned authorities. No meet and greet shall be allowed at the airport.    Inbound passengers will be allowed a preference between two modes of quarantine, government quarantine centers or government regulated hotel/facility. Government quarantine centers will be free of cost. Passengers will be responsible for all expenses arising from their stay if they choose to stay in a government regulated hotel/facility. Passengers will not be able to switch facilities once their quarantine begins unless deemed necessary by the authorities. While the government will try its best to accommodate passengers according to their preferences, paid facilities are limited and cannot be guaranteed. The authorities on the ground will have the final say on where passengers are quarantined.    Detailed SOPs can be found here    Inbound International Private Flights    Limited international private flights are currently allowed by special permission. Upper limit on passengers; and date and time of arrival will be determined by the Civil Aviation Authority and not by the flight operator. Please contact Civil Aviation Authority for information.

These include: (i) reducing the capital conservation buffer by 100 basis points to 1.5 percent; (ii) increase the regulatory limit on extension of credit to SMEs by 44 percent to PRs 180 million ; (iii) relaxation of the debt burden ratio for consumer loans from 50 percent to 60 percent; (iv) allowing banks to defer clients’ payment of principal on loan obligations by one year; (v) relaxation of regulatory criteria for restructured loans for borrowers who require relief beyond the extension of principal repayment for one year; and (vi) suspension of bank dividends for the first two quarters of 2020 to shore up capital."

Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more  than 15 minutes;  2. Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;  3. Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using  proper personal protective equipment  Identification of contacts:  All persons categorized as a contact of confirmed cases should be followed-up, and  monitored for the development of symptoms for 14 days after the last exposure to the  case (i.e. the maximum incubation period). Contacts of suspected cases should also be  considered for contact management if there is likely to be a delay in confirming or  excluding COVID-19 infection in the suspected case, such as delayed testing.  Close contact definition:  A close contact is defined as requiring greater than 15 minutes face-to-face contact with  a symptomatic confirmed case in any setting, or the sharing of a closed space with a  symptomatic confirmed case for a prolonged period (e.g. more than 2 hours).  For the purposes of surveillance, a close contact includes a person meeting any of the  following criteria:  • Living in the same household or household-like setting (e.g. in a boarding school  or hostel).  • Direct contact with the body fluids or laboratory specimens of a case without  recommended PPE.  • A person who spent 2 hours or longer in the same room (such as a GP or ED  waiting room).  • A person in the same hospital room when an aerosol generating procedure is  undertaken on the case, without recommended PPE.  • Face-to-face contact for more than 15 minutes with the case in any other setting  not listed above.  Contact needs to have occurred within the period extending from the day of onset of  symptoms in the case until the case is classified as no longer infectious by the treating  team (usually 24 hours after the resolution of symptoms).  Casual contact definition:  Casual contact is defined as any person having less than 15 minutes face-to-face contact  with a symptomatic confirmed case in any setting, or sharing a closed space with a  symptomatic confirmed case for less than 2 hours. This will include healthcare workers,  other patients, or visitors who were in the same closed healthcare space as a case, but  for shorter periods than those required for a close contact. Other closed settings might  include schools or offices.  Note that healthcare workers and other contacts who have taken recommended infection  control precautions, including the use of full PPE, while caring for a symptomatic  confirmed COVID-19 case are not considered to be close contacts. However, these  people should be advised to self-monitor and if they develop symptoms consistent with  COVID-19 infection they should isolate themselves and notify their public health unit or  staff health unit so they can be tested and managed as a suspected COVID-19 case.  Other casual contacts may include:  • Extended family groups, e.g. in an Aboriginal community.  • Aircraft passengers who were seated in the same row as the case, or in the two  rows in front or two rows behind a symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 case. Contact  tracing of people who may have had close contact on long bus or train trips should  also be attempted where possible, using similar seating/proximity criteria.  • All crew-members on an aircraft who worked in the same cabin area as a  symptomatic confirmed case of COVID-19. If a crew member is the symptomatic  COVID-19 case, contact tracing efforts should concentrate on passengers seated  in the area where the crew member was working during the flight and all of the  other members of the crew.  Where resources permit, more active contact tracing may be extended to other persons  who have had casual contact (as defined above), particularly in school, office, or other  closed settings. In these circumstances, the size of the room/space and degree of  separation of the case from others should be considered in identifying contacts.  Contact assessment:  All persons identified as having had contact with a symptomatic confirmed case should  be assessed to see if they should be classified as a close contact and have demographic  and epidemiological data collected. Information on close contacts should be managed  according to jurisdictional requirements. Identification and assessment of the contacts of  suspected cases may be deferred pending the results of initial laboratory testing.  Close contact testing:  Routine laboratory screening for COVID-19 infection is not recommended for  asymptomatic contacts.  Procedure:  • RRT team shall reach the locality where case reports as per SOPs.  • Team member shall conduct risk assessment of the area and identify the close  contacts as per plan  • The team shall take the sample from the contacts available at the site as per  SOPs  • The detailed information about contacts which are not present at the area of site  must be informed to NIH and the respective agencies.  • The team shall coordinate with local civil authorities about the risk assessment  and advice  • PHEOC team shall facilitate the respective agencies and organization where  relevant contacts may be living or residing  Records:  1. Contact Tracing Forms  2. Contact information forms  3. Sample referral forms  4. PHEOC contract management registers/forms (if any)"

To support the government’s programs to counter the impacts of COVID 19, the BSP purchased PHP 300 billion worth government securities (about 1.5 percent of 2019 GDP) through a repurchase agreement with the government, made secondary market purchases of government securities, and remitted PHP 20 billion as dividend to the government even though it is no longer required to make dividend payments to the government under the newly amended BSP charter. The BSP has also announced a series of regulatory relief measures for the banking sector, including: (1) a temporary relaxation of requirements on compliance reporting, penalties on required reserves, and single borrower limits; (2) easier access to the BSP’s rediscounting facility; (3) a temporary relaxation of provisioning requirements (subject to the BSP approval), and (4) a relaxation of prudential regulations regarding marking-to-market of debt securities. These relief measures are intended to encourage banks, in turn, to provide financial relief to their borrowers (e.g., temporary grace period for loan payments). To encourage extension of loans to enterprises, particularly, micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), the BSP allowed loans to MSMEs to be counted as part of banks’ compliance with reserve requirements, temporarily reduced their credit risk weights to 50 percent, and assigned zero risk weight to loan exposures guaranteed by the Philippine Guarantee Corporation.    http://archive.fo/sGZ1z"

Today we registered the largest single-day COVID-19 caseload - 555 Romanians who were declared positive after being diagnosed. Over the last four weeks, we registered an increase in the number of cases from week to week.    Unlike other countries, in Romania, the Government I am leading, had an approach of the gradual relaxation measures, with restrictions lifting phases, relaxation measures phases, once with opening the activities that have been under restriction in various phases, following increased interaction between people, we witnessed an increase in the number of cases from week to week.  I conclude by conveying a message to every Romanian: The virus does not forgive anyone, nor does it forgive those who do not believe in the existence of the virus. If someone overlooks the rules, neglects and exposes himself to illness, when he becomes ill he not only endangers himself, he also endangers his loved ones, family members, relatives, colleagues, and friends.    When you get sick you risk getting your loved ones sick as you may transmit the virus to those you are most often in close contact with. If you don't care about your health and you don't believe in this virus or you think this virus is not dangerous, please care about your brother, your mother, your father, your child, your friends, your colleagues. Only together, in solidarity and respecting simple rules, established by specialists, those who know very well how to fight against this virus, only together can we bring things back to normal and fight the epidemic effectively. I am confident that every Romanian will understand this watershed moment and will understand that success in the fight against the epidemic will solely depend on responsible and correct behaviour towards fellow citizens.

Sweden,SWE,20201111,,C4: Restrictions on gatherings,0,,"The restrictions for gatherings are part of the Public Order Act and explicitly only for public gatherings (as cited in the C3 notes), not *private* gatherings under the definition of C4. There is no policy for private gatherings for 2 reasons. First, the rationale of the Swedish government is that it is better to issue recommendations and call on people to follow these and be responsible voluntarily, rather than impose them through legislation. With respect to gatherings, most Swedish regions have recommendations in place which ask everyone to refrain from close contact with people they don't live with and non-essential visits to indoor environments like shops, gyms, and museums, all of which are not covered under the Public Order Act. Prime Minister Stefan Löfven has said that ""it's not possible to legislate common sense"" but has also made clear that the rules for gathering under the Public Order Act should also set a ""norm"" for private gatherings, urging people to cancel dinners, parties and trips to gyms or libraries, but these kinds of gatherings are not covered by legislation. A second reason is that the Swedish constitution in its current form does not allow for limits on the number of people who meet privately.

The order from the southwestern state, which comes into effect at 8am on March 24, means the number of US states ordering residents to stay at their residences more than doubled on Monday to 15. Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia and Wisconsin made such announcements earlier in the day.    The 15 states where those orders are effective or about to come into effect cover just over 42 per cent of the population in the 50 states and District of Columbia.    The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US has soared to more than 41,000 as of Monday, 579 of whom have died, according to John Hopkins University. That is more cases than any country after China and Italy, and the number of people who test positive is expected to continue to rise rapidly as the US ramps up the ability to test people with symptoms.    New York is the hardest-hit state, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 5,707 in the past 24 hours, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 20,875.    Some individual cities and counties have issued stay at home orders, even though the states have not. As such, the proportion of the population affected by those restrictions probably exceeds 42 per cent.    Texas, the US's second most-populous state, does not have a stay at home order in place, but local media reported the capital, Austin, was expected to take this route tomorrow, following in the footsteps of Dallas and Waco.  https://www.ft.com/content/f96ada9f-bd2a-39a7-8b59-c4170f5a1101"

They are all required to report to the health authorities and provide a lab specimen for further laboratory diagnosis. (2)When a person seeks medical attention using his or her National Health Insurance (NHI) card, the person’s travel history to areas affected by COVID-19 will display on the system because immigration data is linked to the National Health Insurance Administration. This system helps remind a physician to pay attention to past 14-day travel history and inquire and examine the person accordingly. This can effectively prevent failing to detect a potential case.(3)Since February 16, 2020, we have enhanced COVID-19 case finding by proactively seeking out patients with severe respiratory symptoms who had tested negative for influenza and retested them for COVID-19. In addition, patients who are highly suspected as COVID-19 infection by the physicians as well as medical staff with pneumonia or cluster are also subject to provide specimens for further laboratory diagnosis.
