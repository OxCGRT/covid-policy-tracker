How is contact tracing done for them?   3) When was the first day that testing became available in Afghanistan? When it did, was it available for everyone? Or was there a criteria for who could get tested? What is the criteria (generally available or available to only those who show symptoms) for testing now?    Can you please respond to each questions?

The funeral of a person who dies of the coronavirus should be carried out in accordance with special measures, and with a few close relatives. This also comes as at least 500 mosques were closed in Herat late last week in an attempt by the Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs to slow the spread of the coronavirus in the province. Sunni mosques largely stayed open until April 5, when the Ulema High Commission established to prevent the spread of COVID-19 issued a fatwa to close the mosques and the Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs joined in announcing new restrictions. Prior to the April 5 decision, some mullahs were encouraging people to gather in mosques and pray for a cure. The ministry of public health asked the people to respect the day-time curfew rule and stay in their homes.  https://web.archive.org/web/20200501101104/https://gandhara.rferl.org/a/in-afghanistan-muslim-call-to-prayer-now-carries-stay-at-home-message/30542023.html  https://web.archive.org/web/20200501102039/https://tolonews.com/health/afghan-clerics-ban-religious-political-gatherings-amid-covid-19  https://web.archive.org/web/20200501102534/http://www.afghanistantimes.af/amid-virus-clerics-issue-fatwa-again-religious-political-gatherings/  https://web.archive.org/web/20200501103414/https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/coronavirus-afghanistan-opportunity-build-trust-taliban  "

Central African Republic,CAF,20200416,,H3: Contact tracing,1,,"16 April 2020  The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Central African Republic (CAR) increased sharply in the reporting period, jumping from 12 on 15 April to 64 on 30 April, with still no casualties reported. Imported cases, mostly from Cameroon, CAR’s main trading partner, make up 75% of the total (48 out of 64). The CAR authorities have therefore stepped up efforts to control the flow of travellers coming from Cameroon, increasing sanitary controls at the main border crossings and along the main road to the capital Bangui. On 27 April, the Interior and Transport Ministers issued a joint decree suspending traffic between four main Cameroon border crossing towns (Ngaoundaye, Garoua- a-Boulai, Gamboula and Yantchi) and Bangui for a duration of 1 month. Exceptions apply for commercial trucks, as well as official, and UN and humanitarian NGO vehicles. All active confirmed cases are currently located in the capital Bangui. However, with the current acceleration of both importation and local transmission, the risk that the epidemic will eventually reach the interior of the country is increasing.   https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/UNICEF%20Central%20African%20Republic%20Humanitarian%20Situation%20Report%20COVID-19%20No.%202%20-16-30%20April%202020.pdf    17 April 2020  The MINUSCA Rwanda Contingent has donated a COVID-19 screening device to the Central African Republic (CAR).

You can go out but avoid close contact with other people. Going out is allowed as long as the person keeps a distance of at least 1-2 metres from other people. Stay home if symptomatic and you should stay home as much as possible. Healthy children can go play in playgrounds. To reduce the risk of infection, children should wear outdoor gloves and wash their hands immediately after playing. Public-sector employers will instruct public-sector employees to work from home if their duties make it possible to do so. We can and must still go to forest and enjoy the coming spring in our natural environment. However, we may wish to avoid the most popular hiking destinations and give preference for a day trip e.g. to a forest close to our home. Movie theatres are allowed to remain open, but it is recommended that they be closed. They may also show films, but they must not allow more than ten persons to be present at a screening at the same time.  https://web.archive.org/web/20200425113518/https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/information-on-coronavirus/current-restrictions  https://web.archive.org/web/20200425121730/https://thl.fi/en/web/infectious-diseases/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/frequently-asked-questions-about-coronavirus-covid-19-  https://web.archive.org/web/20200425122428/https://thl.fi/en/web/infectious-diseases/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/instructions-for-citizens-on-coronavirus  https://web.archive.org/web/20200503123029/https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/article/-/asset_publisher/10616/hallitus-totesi-suomen-olevan-poikkeusoloissa-koronavirustilanteen-vuoksi  https://web.archive.org/web/20200503123330/https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/information-on-coronavirus/questions-and-answers  https://web.archive.org/web/20200502101629/https://vnk.fi/en/article/-/asset_publisher/hallitus-totesi-suomen-olevan-poikkeusoloissa-koronavirustilanteen-vuoksi  "

'The work requirement for qualifying for unemployment allowance has been reduced temporarily (.. ) The change will be effective until 6 July 2020.'

There are multiple different types of benefits a person can receive depending on factors such as employment history and union membership. The amount of the base unemployment benefit provided by KELA is means-tested; increases to the base amount will be granted depending on conditions such as the number of children and the availability of other sources of income. Many people who lost their jobs will also be union members who receive earnings-related benefit that are calculated on the basis of duration of employment; in many cases this will be larger than the base amount.     https://web.archive.org/web/20200523110355/https://www.kela.fi/web/en/unemployment-benefit-corona"

Effective immediately, mortgagors who are laid off can apply for a moratorium on all loan payments of three months in the first instance. The NHT will also provide a special one-off offer to contributors, the option to reschedule delinquent loans. The option will only be made available where the Trust has not already entered into a commitment to dispose of the property.    The opportunity will be extended for 6 months, effective April 1, 2020. During this period, the NHT will consider each mortgage on a case-by-case basis, with the option to extend the tenor of the loan or reduce the interest rate.    The measures include:    - Effective April 1, 2020 the NHT will reduce interest rates on all new loans by 1% (benefitting some 8,000 new mortgagors annually)  - All existing NHT loans will be reduced by 0.5% (benefitting some100,000 existing mortgagors).  Interest rate discounts currently offered to special groups, such as mortgagors aged 55 years and over, the disabled as well as public sector workers will continue.  - The interest rate discounts for the disabled will be effective April 1, 2020 and will also be extended to include the parents of disabled children.  - The NHT will expand the Intergenerational Mortgage Program. Beginning April 1, 2020, the NHT will extend this benefit for eligible applicants for other loan products, such as open market purchases and construction loans. Funding under this Program will be capped at the prevailing loan limit.  - The NHT will also provide greater benefits to contributors over 65 years. Persons in this category will be designated as Voluntary Contributors and therefore be able to access housing benefits with tenures extending up to age 70.  - The NHT will establish a special arrangement whereby, following maturity of the loan, the insurance arrangement at special rates may be continued. The cost savings will enable beneficiaries to continue the protection of their properties in a period of life when their earning power may be at its lowest.  - The NHT will, during FY2020/21, seek to leverage its current mortgage loan portfolio through a securitization transaction to generate additional inflows.

These include events at home and outside of home like religious services, parties, weddings, tangihanga and funerals. It is important everyone keeps playing it safe.    This means: While hospitality businesses continue to have the 100 person limit per defined space, group bookings of more than 10 people will be permitted, but the 3 S’s — seated, separated, single-server — still apply. A funeral or tangihanga will also have a 100 person limit, and organisers are no longer required to apply to the Ministry of Health to hold one. Social gatherings at a private dwelling will be able to have a maximum of 100 people. A business or responsible individual, in charge of a social gathering, must ensure records are kept for contact tracing purposes, except where every person in a gathering knows each other. This includes in your home, community hall, or other such space. Participating in community sport will also become easier, with greater numbers of people able to gather up to a limit of 100 people.

Please note that the number and origin of these flights are being constantly reviewed to ensure the timely return of our nationals, whilst ensuring that our capacity to conduct COVID testing and manage these passengers in quarantine facilities is not exceeded. The government is working tirelessly to increase these capacities, and as this capacity continues to grow our ability of passenger intake will also rise.    Scheduled flights for the current week can be viewed here . Please note that these are subject to change depending on the evolving situation.    Upon arrival in Pakistan, all passengers and crew will be subjected to a state-monitored quarantine. Testing will be conducted as soon as possible after arrival, usually before 24 hours. Testing results are returned within a 12-24 hours window. Please note that these might be delayed in some cases due to heavy load of inbound passenger traffic.    The quarantine can be extended based on the result of the passenger’s COVID-19 test, or upon the discretion of governmental health authorities considering the overall test results of the flight. Passengers who are sent home after a negative test will be advised compulsory self-isolation to complete a 14-day period. Low risk and asymptomatic positive test results may also be sent home for self-isolation upon the discretion of provincial health authorities subject to review of isolation capabilities at home.    The transportation to the quarantine location shall be arranged by the concerned authorities. No meet and greet shall be allowed at the airport.    Inbound passengers will be allowed a preference between two modes of quarantine, government quarantine centers or government regulated hotel/facility. Government quarantine centers will be free of cost. Passengers will be responsible for all expenses arising from their stay if they choose to stay in a government regulated hotel/facility. Passengers will not be able to switch facilities once their quarantine begins unless deemed necessary by the authorities. While the government will try its best to accommodate passengers according to their preferences, paid facilities are limited and cannot be guaranteed. The authorities on the ground will have the final say on where passengers are quarantined.    Detailed SOPs can be found here    Inbound International Private Flights    Limited international private flights are currently allowed by special permission. Upper limit on passengers; and date and time of arrival will be determined by the Civil Aviation Authority and not by the flight operator. Please contact Civil Aviation Authority for information.

These include: (i) reducing the capital conservation buffer by 100 basis points to 1.5 percent; (ii) increase the regulatory limit on extension of credit to SMEs by 44 percent to PRs 180 million ; (iii) relaxation of the debt burden ratio for consumer loans from 50 percent to 60 percent; (iv) allowing banks to defer clients’ payment of principal on loan obligations by one year; (v) relaxation of regulatory criteria for restructured loans for borrowers who require relief beyond the extension of principal repayment for one year; and (vi) suspension of bank dividends for the first two quarters of 2020 to shore up capital."

Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more  than 15 minutes;  2. Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;  3. Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using  proper personal protective equipment  Identification of contacts:  All persons categorized as a contact of confirmed cases should be followed-up, and  monitored for the development of symptoms for 14 days after the last exposure to the  case (i.e. the maximum incubation period). Contacts of suspected cases should also be  considered for contact management if there is likely to be a delay in confirming or  excluding COVID-19 infection in the suspected case, such as delayed testing.  Close contact definition:  A close contact is defined as requiring greater than 15 minutes face-to-face contact with  a symptomatic confirmed case in any setting, or the sharing of a closed space with a  symptomatic confirmed case for a prolonged period (e.g. more than 2 hours).  For the purposes of surveillance, a close contact includes a person meeting any of the  following criteria:  • Living in the same household or household-like setting (e.g. in a boarding school  or hostel).  • Direct contact with the body fluids or laboratory specimens of a case without  recommended PPE.  • A person who spent 2 hours or longer in the same room (such as a GP or ED  waiting room).  • A person in the same hospital room when an aerosol generating procedure is  undertaken on the case, without recommended PPE.  • Face-to-face contact for more than 15 minutes with the case in any other setting  not listed above.  Contact needs to have occurred within the period extending from the day of onset of  symptoms in the case until the case is classified as no longer infectious by the treating  team (usually 24 hours after the resolution of symptoms).  Casual contact definition:  Casual contact is defined as any person having less than 15 minutes face-to-face contact  with a symptomatic confirmed case in any setting, or sharing a closed space with a  symptomatic confirmed case for less than 2 hours. This will include healthcare workers,  other patients, or visitors who were in the same closed healthcare space as a case, but  for shorter periods than those required for a close contact. Other closed settings might  include schools or offices.  Note that healthcare workers and other contacts who have taken recommended infection  control precautions, including the use of full PPE, while caring for a symptomatic  confirmed COVID-19 case are not considered to be close contacts. However, these  people should be advised to self-monitor and if they develop symptoms consistent with  COVID-19 infection they should isolate themselves and notify their public health unit or  staff health unit so they can be tested and managed as a suspected COVID-19 case.  Other casual contacts may include:  • Extended family groups, e.g. in an Aboriginal community.  • Aircraft passengers who were seated in the same row as the case, or in the two  rows in front or two rows behind a symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 case. Contact  tracing of people who may have had close contact on long bus or train trips should  also be attempted where possible, using similar seating/proximity criteria.  • All crew-members on an aircraft who worked in the same cabin area as a  symptomatic confirmed case of COVID-19. If a crew member is the symptomatic  COVID-19 case, contact tracing efforts should concentrate on passengers seated  in the area where the crew member was working during the flight and all of the  other members of the crew.  Where resources permit, more active contact tracing may be extended to other persons  who have had casual contact (as defined above), particularly in school, office, or other  closed settings. In these circumstances, the size of the room/space and degree of  separation of the case from others should be considered in identifying contacts.  Contact assessment:  All persons identified as having had contact with a symptomatic confirmed case should  be assessed to see if they should be classified as a close contact and have demographic  and epidemiological data collected. Information on close contacts should be managed  according to jurisdictional requirements. Identification and assessment of the contacts of  suspected cases may be deferred pending the results of initial laboratory testing.  Close contact testing:  Routine laboratory screening for COVID-19 infection is not recommended for  asymptomatic contacts.  Procedure:  • RRT team shall reach the locality where case reports as per SOPs.  • Team member shall conduct risk assessment of the area and identify the close  contacts as per plan  • The team shall take the sample from the contacts available at the site as per  SOPs  • The detailed information about contacts which are not present at the area of site  must be informed to NIH and the respective agencies.  • The team shall coordinate with local civil authorities about the risk assessment  and advice  • PHEOC team shall facilitate the respective agencies and organization where  relevant contacts may be living or residing  Records:  1.

The order from the southwestern state, which comes into effect at 8am on March 24, means the number of US states ordering residents to stay at their residences more than doubled on Monday to 15. Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia and Wisconsin made such announcements earlier in the day.    The 15 states where those orders are effective or about to come into effect cover just over 42 per cent of the population in the 50 states and District of Columbia.    The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US has soared to more than 41,000 as of Monday, 579 of whom have died, according to John Hopkins University. That is more cases than any country after China and Italy, and the number of people who test positive is expected to continue to rise rapidly as the US ramps up the ability to test people with symptoms.    New York is the hardest-hit state, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 5,707 in the past 24 hours, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 20,875.    Some individual cities and counties have issued stay at home orders, even though the states have not. As such, the proportion of the population affected by those restrictions probably exceeds 42 per cent.    Texas, the US's second most-populous state, does not have a stay at home order in place, but local media reported the capital, Austin, was expected to take this route tomorrow, following in the footsteps of Dallas and Waco.  https://www.ft.com/content/f96ada9f-bd2a-39a7-8b59-c4170f5a1101"

They are all required to report to the health authorities and provide a lab specimen for further laboratory diagnosis. (2)When a person seeks medical attention using his or her National Health Insurance (NHI) card, the person’s travel history to areas affected by COVID-19 will display on the system because immigration data is linked to the National Health Insurance Administration. This system helps remind a physician to pay attention to past 14-day travel history and inquire and examine the person accordingly. This can effectively prevent failing to detect a potential case.(3)Since February 16, 2020, we have enhanced COVID-19 case finding by proactively seeking out patients with severe respiratory symptoms who had tested negative for influenza and retested them for COVID-19. In addition, patients who are highly suspected as COVID-19 infection by the physicians as well as medical staff with pneumonia or cluster are also subject to provide specimens for further laboratory diagnosis.
