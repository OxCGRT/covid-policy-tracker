Is that true of all of them?   2) When did MoPH started contact tracing? The document says that contact tracing happens for those who test positive or show symptoms upon arriving to mentioned airports and border points. What if someone tests positive in other locations? How is contact tracing done for them?   3) When was the first day that testing became available in Afghanistan? When it did, was it available for everyone? Or was there a criteria for who could get tested? What is the criteria (generally available or available to only those who show symptoms) for testing now?    Can you please respond to each questions? If you don't have answers, please let me know and I will try to reach out to others.     Thanks so much!""

The contact tracing is done for all confirmed cases form all over the country through phone calls. There has been a form, SoP, and guidelines developed for the purpose, I am copying Momena Jan (the national focal point of contact tracing) for more info if needed.   The testing was available in early February and it was based on the case definition of that time (only people coming from China in points of entries having sign and symptoms of the disease were tested) then when Iran was also confirmed as a country with transmission potentials, the passengers from Iran was also screened and if they had sign and symptoms they were also being tested.

In conjunction  with active case finding and testing, and in synergy with other measures such as physical  distancing, contact tracing is recommended in all transmission scenarios.

People in close contact with COVID-19 cases are at high  risk of being infected with COVID-19, and, if infected, may also transmit the infection to  others. This guideline details how once a COVID-19 case has been identified, the Ministry  of Health and Wellness (MoHW) through District Health Management Teams (DHMT) and  other implementing partners will track, trace and manage people who may have been  exposed to COVID-19.

Imported cases, mostly from Cameroon, CAR’s main trading partner, make up 75% of the total (48 out of 64). The CAR authorities have therefore stepped up efforts to control the flow of travellers coming from Cameroon, increasing sanitary controls at the main border crossings and along the main road to the capital Bangui. On 27 April, the Interior and Transport Ministers issued a joint decree suspending traffic between four main Cameroon border crossing towns (Ngaoundaye, Garoua- a-Boulai, Gamboula and Yantchi) and Bangui for a duration of 1 month. Exceptions apply for commercial trucks, as well as official, and UN and humanitarian NGO vehicles. All active confirmed cases are currently located in the capital Bangui. However, with the current acceleration of both importation and local transmission, the risk that the epidemic will eventually reach the interior of the country is increasing.   https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/UNICEF%20Central%20African%20Republic%20Humanitarian%20Situation%20Report%20COVID-19%20No.%202%20-16-30%20April%202020.pdf    17 April 2020  The MINUSCA Rwanda Contingent has donated a COVID-19 screening device to the Central African Republic (CAR).

Greece,GRC,20200601,20200621,C1: School closing,1,1,"It was decided by the Government to reopen the kindergartens, primary and special education schools of all levels from Monday, June 1, 2020.    This decision was based on the following factors:    First and foremost, in the unanimous proposal of the Public Health Emergency Management Committee by Infectious Diseases for the reopening of these school structures. This suggestion is certainly linked to the steadily declining course of the epidemic, with children having a harder time transmitting and transmitting the virus, and now that the temperature is rising, the safest time to open schools is epidemiologically. Since the beginning of this health crisis, we have had the privilege of being guided by an excellent team of experts, whose recommendations we follow with very good, internationally recognized results. So we go now, and we thank them warmly.  The overall de-escalation of measures has been very positive. As for schools, the previous experience of opening high schools and lyceums is very encouraging. The protection and prevention measures are modeled on the members of the educational community and everything has gone extremely smoothly.  We must ensure the return of all students to their physical space, which is none other than school. The long absence from school hinders their learning process, their spiritual, social, mental development. Primary school students are already out of school for almost 3 months, and would have been there for a total of 6 months if the schools had not been opened now. There can be no regularity without open schools.  Children are safer in school, where they follow rules and follow protection and prevention measures, rather than in neighborhoods and squares without rules. There is no better place than school to adapt and get children used to the new reality. To learn to pay more attention to every aspect of their daily lives.  Open schools reduce social inequalities and empower children from more vulnerable family backgrounds. Students who do not have modern technological equipment, students who experience tension in their family environment, students of the smallest mainly classes who do not have family guidance for distance education.  Regarding special schools, students attending these schools have a special need to be back in their school environment, with their teachers and classmates. And they obviously need it for their learning development but also for their psycho-emotional and social development.  I now turn to how these educational structures reopen:    Regarding primary and secondary schools, they will reopen on Monday, June 1. Classes will be extended until Friday, June 26 (instead of June 15), while for teachers as a whole, the end of the school year will be June 30. For substitute teachers, their contracts will be extended until June 30.  School and kindergarten departments will operate with up to 15 students at a time and with a distance of 1.5 meters on the desks, which will have the same orientation. If the students exceed 15, then the department will be divided into 2 sub-departments, and will operate in rotation, Monday-Wednesday-Friday one, Tuesday-Thursday the other, and next week the opposite. If the students do not exceed 15, then the class will be open daily.  There will be antiseptics in the rooms, cleaning is provided twice a day, both during and after school. Special legislation and additional funds have been provided for the amendment of the contracts of the cleaning staff, as well as the possibility for the recruitment of additional cleaning staff. We thank the Ministry of Interior and the Municipalities for the excellent cooperation in this area.  Breaks are provided at different times to reduce congestion, and canteens are not allowed to operate.  Natural ventilation of the rooms is provided, the use of the mask is optional for teachers and students (both at school and on school buses), special EODY instructions will be sent in the coming days to all primary education structures, and a significant part of the first day will be dedicated to explanation of these instructions. There is a special concern for teachers who fall into the category of special leave of absence as defined by the Ministry of Interior. There is also the possibility of a student being absent, on the basis of a simple responsible statement from a parent or guardian about the existence of a person in the home who belongs to an increased risk group or who is ill.  There is the possibility of modern distance learning by teachers for those students who fall into categories that justify their absence.  For the time being, all-day schools will not be open.  For special schools: they will reopen on June 1st to June 12th for secondary school and until June 26th for primary school. The competent subcommittee of infectious diseases specialists is meeting today to give special instructions for the reopening of the special education units. There will be strict protection measures    https://web.archive.org/web/20200618002455/https://www.minedu.gov.gr/news/45093-25-05-20-omilia-tis-ypourgoy-paideias-thriskevmaton-nikis-kerameos-gia-ta-dimotika-sxoleia-kai-nipiagogeia-2"

The ministry will set up a screening area at the Toussaint L'Overture International Airport in Port-Au-Prince, as well as an area to quarantine passengers suspected of carrying the new coronavirus.  The Director General of the Public Health Service, Dr. Laure Adrien, stressed at a press conference there are no known cases of coronavirus in Haiti, but the ministry wants to actively address the threat from the fast spreading infection.  Haiti's poor public health infrastructure and tightly packed neighborhoods make the island vulnerable to a fast-spreading infection like the coronavirus, and once established in the country would be hard to contain and treat.  Authorities will target passengers coming from affected countries in Asia for special screening and monitoring once they arrive in the country.

Interest rate discounts currently offered to special groups, such as mortgagors aged 55 years and over, the disabled as well as public sector workers will continue.  - The interest rate discounts for the disabled will be effective April 1, 2020 and will also be extended to include the parents of disabled children.  - The NHT will expand the Intergenerational Mortgage Program. Beginning April 1, 2020, the NHT will extend this benefit for eligible applicants for other loan products, such as open market purchases and construction loans. Funding under this Program will be capped at the prevailing loan limit.  - The NHT will also provide greater benefits to contributors over 65 years. Persons in this category will be designated as Voluntary Contributors and therefore be able to access housing benefits with tenures extending up to age 70.  - The NHT will establish a special arrangement whereby, following maturity of the loan, the insurance arrangement at special rates may be continued. The cost savings will enable beneficiaries to continue the protection of their properties in a period of life when their earning power may be at its lowest.  - The NHT will, during FY2020/21, seek to leverage its current mortgage loan portfolio through a securitization transaction to generate additional inflows.    Covid Student’s Loan Bureau  Jamaica will be deferring principal and interest payments on student loans for the three-month period April – June to cushion the impact on young graduates while giving new graduates 14 months to start payment their student loans after graduation.

When such businesses file and pay their payroll returns as usual on the 15th of April, May and June, for each employee, with taxable income that is less than 1.5 on whose behalf statutory returns are applied, the Government will transfer funds at a rate of $9,000 per fortnight to that tourism related business, by direct transfer to their bank account, paid monthly.

New Zealand,NZL,20200529,20200607,C4: Restrictions on gatherings,2,1,"Friday 29 May 2020. Amendments to Alert Level 2 —  part of the gradual easing of restrictions that will happen as we move towards Alert Level 1.    ""Social gatherings can be held with up to 100 people    The limit for social gatherings will be lifted to 100 people. These include events at home and outside of home like religious services, parties, weddings, tangihanga and funerals. It is important everyone keeps playing it safe.    This means: While hospitality businesses continue to have the 100 person limit per defined space, group bookings of more than 10 people will be permitted, but the 3 S’s — seated, separated, single-server — still apply. A funeral or tangihanga will also have a 100 person limit, and organisers are no longer required to apply to the Ministry of Health to hold one. Social gatherings at a private dwelling will be able to have a maximum of 100 people. A business or responsible individual, in charge of a social gathering, must ensure records are kept for contact tracing purposes, except where every person in a gathering knows each other. This includes in your home, community hall, or other such space. Participating in community sport will also become easier, with greater numbers of people able to gather up to a limit of 100 people. Requirements for contact tracing still remain. Workers providing a service to a social gathering, such as waiters at a wedding, are not included in the 100 person limit.""    /web/20200602033409/https://covid19.govt.nz/latest-updates/alert-level-2-changes-confirmed-for-friday-29-may/"

Please note that the number and origin of these flights are being constantly reviewed to ensure the timely return of our nationals, whilst ensuring that our capacity to conduct COVID testing and manage these passengers in quarantine facilities is not exceeded. The government is working tirelessly to increase these capacities, and as this capacity continues to grow our ability of passenger intake will also rise.    Scheduled flights for the current week can be viewed here . Please note that these are subject to change depending on the evolving situation.    Upon arrival in Pakistan, all passengers and crew will be subjected to a state-monitored quarantine. Testing will be conducted as soon as possible after arrival, usually before 24 hours. Testing results are returned within a 12-24 hours window. Please note that these might be delayed in some cases due to heavy load of inbound passenger traffic.    The quarantine can be extended based on the result of the passenger’s COVID-19 test, or upon the discretion of governmental health authorities considering the overall test results of the flight. Passengers who are sent home after a negative test will be advised compulsory self-isolation to complete a 14-day period. Low risk and asymptomatic positive test results may also be sent home for self-isolation upon the discretion of provincial health authorities subject to review of isolation capabilities at home.    The transportation to the quarantine location shall be arranged by the concerned authorities. No meet and greet shall be allowed at the airport.    Inbound passengers will be allowed a preference between two modes of quarantine, government quarantine centers or government regulated hotel/facility. Government quarantine centers will be free of cost. Passengers will be responsible for all expenses arising from their stay if they choose to stay in a government regulated hotel/facility. Passengers will not be able to switch facilities once their quarantine begins unless deemed necessary by the authorities. While the government will try its best to accommodate passengers according to their preferences, paid facilities are limited and cannot be guaranteed. The authorities on the ground will have the final say on where passengers are quarantined.

Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more  than 15 minutes;  2. Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;  3. Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using  proper personal protective equipment  Identification of contacts:  All persons categorized as a contact of confirmed cases should be followed-up, and  monitored for the development of symptoms for 14 days after the last exposure to the  case (i.e. the maximum incubation period). Contacts of suspected cases should also be  considered for contact management if there is likely to be a delay in confirming or  excluding COVID-19 infection in the suspected case, such as delayed testing.  Close contact definition:  A close contact is defined as requiring greater than 15 minutes face-to-face contact with  a symptomatic confirmed case in any setting, or the sharing of a closed space with a  symptomatic confirmed case for a prolonged period (e.g. more than 2 hours).  For the purposes of surveillance, a close contact includes a person meeting any of the  following criteria:  • Living in the same household or household-like setting (e.g. in a boarding school  or hostel).  • Direct contact with the body fluids or laboratory specimens of a case without  recommended PPE.  • A person who spent 2 hours or longer in the same room (such as a GP or ED  waiting room).  • A person in the same hospital room when an aerosol generating procedure is  undertaken on the case, without recommended PPE.  • Face-to-face contact for more than 15 minutes with the case in any other setting  not listed above.  Contact needs to have occurred within the period extending from the day of onset of  symptoms in the case until the case is classified as no longer infectious by the treating  team (usually 24 hours after the resolution of symptoms).  Casual contact definition:  Casual contact is defined as any person having less than 15 minutes face-to-face contact  with a symptomatic confirmed case in any setting, or sharing a closed space with a  symptomatic confirmed case for less than 2 hours. This will include healthcare workers,  other patients, or visitors who were in the same closed healthcare space as a case, but  for shorter periods than those required for a close contact. Other closed settings might  include schools or offices.  Note that healthcare workers and other contacts who have taken recommended infection  control precautions, including the use of full PPE, while caring for a symptomatic  confirmed COVID-19 case are not considered to be close contacts. However, these  people should be advised to self-monitor and if they develop symptoms consistent with  COVID-19 infection they should isolate themselves and notify their public health unit or  staff health unit so they can be tested and managed as a suspected COVID-19 case.  Other casual contacts may include:  • Extended family groups, e.g. in an Aboriginal community.  • Aircraft passengers who were seated in the same row as the case, or in the two  rows in front or two rows behind a symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 case. Contact  tracing of people who may have had close contact on long bus or train trips should  also be attempted where possible, using similar seating/proximity criteria.  • All crew-members on an aircraft who worked in the same cabin area as a  symptomatic confirmed case of COVID-19. If a crew member is the symptomatic  COVID-19 case, contact tracing efforts should concentrate on passengers seated  in the area where the crew member was working during the flight and all of the  other members of the crew.  Where resources permit, more active contact tracing may be extended to other persons  who have had casual contact (as defined above), particularly in school, office, or other  closed settings. In these circumstances, the size of the room/space and degree of  separation of the case from others should be considered in identifying contacts.  Contact assessment:  All persons identified as having had contact with a symptomatic confirmed case should  be assessed to see if they should be classified as a close contact and have demographic  and epidemiological data collected. Information on close contacts should be managed  according to jurisdictional requirements. Identification and assessment of the contacts of  suspected cases may be deferred pending the results of initial laboratory testing.  Close contact testing:  Routine laboratory screening for COVID-19 infection is not recommended for  asymptomatic contacts.  Procedure:  • RRT team shall reach the locality where case reports as per SOPs.  • Team member shall conduct risk assessment of the area and identify the close  contacts as per plan  • The team shall take the sample from the contacts available at the site as per  SOPs  • The detailed information about contacts which are not present at the area of site  must be informed to NIH and the respective agencies.  • The team shall coordinate with local civil authorities about the risk assessment  and advice  • PHEOC team shall facilitate the respective agencies and organization where  relevant contacts may be living or residing  Records:  1.

To support the government’s programs to counter the impacts of COVID 19, the BSP purchased PHP 300 billion worth government securities (about 1.5 percent of 2019 GDP) through a repurchase agreement with the government, made secondary market purchases of government securities, and remitted PHP 20 billion as dividend to the government even though it is no longer required to make dividend payments to the government under the newly amended BSP charter. The BSP has also announced a series of regulatory relief measures for the banking sector, including: (1) a temporary relaxation of requirements on compliance reporting, penalties on required reserves, and single borrower limits; (2) easier access to the BSP’s rediscounting facility; (3) a temporary relaxation of provisioning requirements (subject to the BSP approval), and (4) a relaxation of prudential regulations regarding marking-to-market of debt securities. These relief measures are intended to encourage banks, in turn, to provide financial relief to their borrowers (e.g., temporary grace period for loan payments). To encourage extension of loans to enterprises, particularly, micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), the BSP allowed loans to MSMEs to be counted as part of banks’ compliance with reserve requirements, temporarily reduced their credit risk weights to 50 percent, and assigned zero risk weight to loan exposures guaranteed by the Philippine Guarantee Corporation.    http://archive.fo/sGZ1z"

Today we registered the largest single-day COVID-19 caseload - 555 Romanians who were declared positive after being diagnosed. Over the last four weeks, we registered an increase in the number of cases from week to week.    Unlike other countries, in Romania, the Government I am leading, had an approach of the gradual relaxation measures, with restrictions lifting phases, relaxation measures phases, once with opening the activities that have been under restriction in various phases, following increased interaction between people, we witnessed an increase in the number of cases from week to week.  I conclude by conveying a message to every Romanian: The virus does not forgive anyone, nor does it forgive those who do not believe in the existence of the virus. If someone overlooks the rules, neglects and exposes himself to illness, when he becomes ill he not only endangers himself, he also endangers his loved ones, family members, relatives, colleagues, and friends.    When you get sick you risk getting your loved ones sick as you may transmit the virus to those you are most often in close contact with. If you don't care about your health and you don't believe in this virus or you think this virus is not dangerous, please care about your brother, your mother, your father, your child, your friends, your colleagues. Only together, in solidarity and respecting simple rules, established by specialists, those who know very well how to fight against this virus, only together can we bring things back to normal and fight the epidemic effectively. I am confident that every Romanian will understand this watershed moment and will understand that success in the fight against the epidemic will solely depend on responsible and correct behaviour towards fellow citizens.

The order from the southwestern state, which comes into effect at 8am on March 24, means the number of US states ordering residents to stay at their residences more than doubled on Monday to 15. Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia and Wisconsin made such announcements earlier in the day.    The 15 states where those orders are effective or about to come into effect cover just over 42 per cent of the population in the 50 states and District of Columbia.    The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US has soared to more than 41,000 as of Monday, 579 of whom have died, according to John Hopkins University. That is more cases than any country after China and Italy, and the number of people who test positive is expected to continue to rise rapidly as the US ramps up the ability to test people with symptoms.    New York is the hardest-hit state, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 5,707 in the past 24 hours, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 20,875.    Some individual cities and counties have issued stay at home orders, even though the states have not. As such, the proportion of the population affected by those restrictions probably exceeds 42 per cent.    Texas, the US's second most-populous state, does not have a stay at home order in place, but local media reported the capital, Austin, was expected to take this route tomorrow, following in the footsteps of Dallas and Waco.  https://www.ft.com/content/f96ada9f-bd2a-39a7-8b59-c4170f5a1101"

(2)When a person seeks medical attention using his or her National Health Insurance (NHI) card, the person’s travel history to areas affected by COVID-19 will display on the system because immigration data is linked to the National Health Insurance Administration. This system helps remind a physician to pay attention to past 14-day travel history and inquire and examine the person accordingly. This can effectively prevent failing to detect a potential case.(3)Since February 16, 2020, we have enhanced COVID-19 case finding by proactively seeking out patients with severe respiratory symptoms who had tested negative for influenza and retested them for COVID-19. In addition, patients who are highly suspected as COVID-19 infection by the physicians as well as medical staff with pneumonia or cluster are also subject to provide specimens for further laboratory diagnosis.
