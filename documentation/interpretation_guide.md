# OxCGRT Coding Interpretation Guide
###  Version 1.0
### Date: 25 September, 2020

This guide details the resolutions of frequently asked codebook interpretation queries, in order to ensure consistency, and standardize coding across the database. Queries related specifically to subnational data collection are labelled as such.

##  Guidance by codebook indicator

### C1 - School Closures

- School closures and university closures are captured in C1. Closed schools do not count as a closed workplace sector for C2.
- Different governments use different wording (e.g. soft-closing, recommend, strongly recommend, recommend without restricting civil liberty), so we standardize what these mean in practice when we code. If the situation is that all schools are closed, or policies in place make it impossible for them to open and meet these requirements, then that would count as a full closure. 
- Childcare, nurseries, language courses, and driving schools, do not count as educational closures. These should be coded as workplaces under C2.
- If schools are closed, and this same closure policy then rolls into school holidays, we keep the code the same, for example ‘all levels of education remain closed’. This coding would only go down only once students are allowed to return, when schools reopen.
- If only children of essential workers are allowed in schools, this is coded as a closure for the general public.
- If in-person teaching is suspended and all  instruction is online, this is coded as closed (physically closed).
- If schools are only open for exams, but not for classes, coding depends. If schools are open for a one off exam, for example one that is an hour long, or one to one, on one day only, this would not change the coding, so school closures would remain at a 3 if all levels are otherwise closed.
- If exams are running for morning and afternoon sessions, on multiple days, or even over multiple weeks, this is a similar situation to classes being open for some groups (2), where there are groups of students in a communal area in an educational establishment, so would warrant coding this as such. Note that after the exam period ends, schools may jump back up to a 3 if all levels of education are then closed.
- If teachers are back in school to prepare for the new school year, but no students are allowed back, this would not alter the coding, as no students are present in person for education.
- If the situation is that schools are in theory allowed to open, but all schools remain closed, or policies in place make it impossible for them to open and meet these requirements, then that would count as a full closure.
- If individual school districts have the authority to decide closures/openings, we code policies conservatively with a T flag, as a G would require a high level of confidence that all schools in a jurisdiction are closed. If the state/nation is transitioning from a period of state or nationally induced total closure (3G) to giving individual districts the authority to choose, and some districts still follow the stricter policy, a 3T code would be a good choice. 
- We take account of summer school openings. If schools have been closed (3) but then some summer school is allowed, the value would change (likely 3T if some school districts remain totally closed, or a 2G).
